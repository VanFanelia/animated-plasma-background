# Gemischte T端te - Component Library

"Gemischte T端te" Component Library is a set of [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) components for Android developer. 
This Library has no intention of beeing a full - feature complete Component Library. It is more like a random set of sometimes usefull components which are missing in the default libraries. 

## Compose versions

In Future releases we want to build different versions for different jetpack compose Major Versions. But at the moment the components are fixed to Compose 1.1.

| Compose Version | Library Version |
| :---: | :-: |
| Compose 1.1 | [![](https://jitpack.io/v/VanFanelia/gemischte-tuete-component-library.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#VanFanelia/gemischte-tuete-component-library) |

## How to use this library

**Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file**

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

**Step 2. Add the dependency for the component you need**

Every component has it own dependency, so you pick just the components you need and add the dependency in your app/module build.gradle file
```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.VanFanelia:gemischte-tuete-component-library:<Component>:<Version>'
}
```

If you use **maven**, **sbt**, **leiningen** see [HowTo on JitPack.io](https://jitpack.io/#VanFanelia/gemischte-tuete-component-library#howto)

## Why the name

In urban regions of germany small kids often buy sweets and candy from kiosk. To get a mixed bag of random brands you need to order a "gemischte T端te" (mixed bag). This component library has no intention to be a complete design system or a Component Library like Bootstrap or Material UI. It is just a collection of beautiful components without a relation to each other. The creators wants to share these components and find a single place to present them. This is "Gemischte T端te Component Library". A mixed bag of components for different tastes.
